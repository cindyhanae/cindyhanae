<h3>About me</h3>
<h4>Below I'll tell a little bit of my crazy journey to become a front end dev!</h4>   
<p>I started Law school with the objective of applying to a position as civil servant, but from the start i noticed that I didn't fit in that environment. Even so, i did a graduate course, worked at government departments and applied to many positions, but with no success which made me feel frustrated and unsatisfied with my graduation.</p>
