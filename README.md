<h2 color="red">About me</h2>
<h3>Below I'll tell a little bit of my crazy journey to become a front end dev!</h3>  

I started Law school with the objective of applying to a position as civil servant, but from the start i noticed that I didn't fit in that environment. Even so, i did a graduate course, worked at government departments and applied to many positions, but with no success which made me feel frustrated and unsatisfied with my graduation.

I started Law school not because I liked or wanted, but because I was on that crazy period of college entrance exam and I didn't know by that time what I wanted for life :neutral_face: So my objective during Law school was to apply to a position as civil servant, but from the start I noticed that I didn't fit in that environment. Even so, I did a graduate course, worked at government departments and applied to many positions as civil servant but with no success, which made me feel frustrated and anguished.

At certain point, i decided to turn my cookling hobby into an occupation.
