<h2 color="red">More about me</h2>
<h3>Below I'll tell a little bit of my crazy journey to become a front end dev!</h3>  

<!-- I started Law school with the objective of applying to a position as civil servant, but from the start i noticed that I didn't fit in that environment. Even so, i did a graduate course, worked at government departments and applied to many positions, but with no success which made me feel frustrated and unsatisfied with my graduation. -->

I started { ***Law school*** } not because I liked or wanted, but because I was on that crazy period of college entrance exam and I didn't know by that time what I wanted for life :neutral_face:  So my objective during Law school was to apply to a position as civil servant, but from the start I noticed that I didn't fit in that environment. Even so, I did a graduate course, worked at government departments and applied to many positions as civil servant but with no success, which made me feel frustrated and anguished.

At certain point, I decided to turn my cooking hobby into an occupation and started a { ***boulangerie and patisserie course*** }. Since I was a kid i loved to bake cakes and I thought it would be a good idea to give it a try. People say: work with what you love and you'll never have to work in life again! Well, it didn't go that way. I worked at a candy store and learned to bake delightful cakes, cookies, brigadeiros and other goodies :yum: I liked it but I felt in my skin what it's like to do mechanical and repetitive work all day long. So I resolved that I would give a last try on the applications to positions as civil servant Then came the covid-19 pandemic :chart_with_downwards_trend:   

Because of the pandemic, all applications were suspended indefinitely. In view of this, I started a { ***front end developer*** } course, which I was very curious since my adolescence because of the old personal blogs. This course was the light in the dark in the middle of the pandemic. It opened my mind and I was amazed by how exciting it was to start a website from the scratch, to see it taking form from codes, to solve bugs problems and learn even more about front end. That's when I decided I wanted to make career as front end developer. So now I want to gain experience, take courses in the area and learn new languages and frameworks to improve my curriculum and professional background :smiley::computer:

<!-- After going through all this, I've learned to be resilient,  -->
